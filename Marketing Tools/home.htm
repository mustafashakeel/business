<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The author, the publisher, and the vendor of these forms make no representations or warranties regarding the outcome or the use to which these forms are put and are not assuming any liability for any claims, losses, or damages arising out of the use of these forms. The user of these forms should not rely on the author or publisher of these forms for any professional advice.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>Follow these steps for using the computer form(s):</p>
<ol>
<li>Using your word-processing software, open the appropriate file.<br><br></li>
<li>Complete the form(s) according to your wishes. If instructions were included with the package, please be sure to read them as you go along.<br><br>Note that each computer form has been designed to look as close as possible to the original Self-Counsel Press printed form. The final appearance of your computer form will depend upon what type of printer and word-processing software you are using. As a result, some modifications may be necessary. In particular, page breaks or blank lines may have to be inserted to ensure that related lines of text remain on the same page.<br><br>You may wish to print a copy of the form using Acrobat Reader, as a guide. The computer form&#8217;s design allows you to fill in all, some, or none of the blank sections before printing. Most of these blank sections are represented by a number of underscore characters like this "_______________." Sometimes these sections may be too long for your computer to fit on the current line, resulting in text which may look like:
<pre>
                          n a m e   o f   p e r s o n______________
___________  
</pre>
instead of:
<pre>
  name of person______________________________
</pre>
If you do not wish to fill in the person&#8217;s name just yet, then simply delete a few of the underscore characters until the blank section fits on the appropriate line.<br><br></li>
<li>Review your work.<br><br></li>
<li>Print and sign!</li></ol>
